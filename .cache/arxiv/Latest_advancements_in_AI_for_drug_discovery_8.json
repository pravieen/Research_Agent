      "summary": "Self-driving labs are transforming drug discovery by enabling automated,\nAI-guided experimentation, but they face challenges in orchestrating complex\nworkflows, integrating diverse instruments and AI models, and managing data\nefficiently. Artificial addresses these issues with a comprehensive\norchestration and scheduling system that unifies lab operations, automates\nworkflows, and integrates AI-driven decision-making. By incorporating AI/ML\nmodels like NVIDIA BioNeMo - which facilitates molecular interaction prediction\nand biomolecular analysis - Artificial enhances drug discovery and accelerates\ndata-driven research. Through real-time coordination of instruments, robots,\nand personnel, the platform streamlines experiments, enhances reproducibility,\nand advances drug discovery.",

      "summary": "Drug addiction is a complex and pervasive global challenge that continues to\npose significant public health concerns. Traditional approaches to\nanti-addiction drug discovery have struggled to deliver effective therapeutics,\nfacing high attrition rates, long development timelines, and inefficiencies in\nprocessing large-scale data. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a\ntransformative solution to address these issues. Using advanced algorithms, AI\nis revolutionizing drug discovery by enhancing the speed and precision of key\nprocesses. This review explores the transformative role of AI in the pipeline\nfor anti-addiction drug discovery, including data collection, target\nidentification, and compound optimization. By highlighting the potential of AI\nto overcome traditional barriers, this review systematically examines how AI\naddresses critical gaps in anti-addiction research, emphasizing its potential\nto revolutionize drug discovery and development, overcome challenges, and\nadvance more effective therapeutic strategies.",

      "summary": "Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has drawn attention to their\npotential for accelerating drug discovery. However, a central problem remains:\ntranslating theoretical ideas into robust implementations in the highly\nspecialized context of pharmaceutical research. This limitation prevents\npractitioners from making full use of the latest AI developments in drug\ndiscovery. To address this challenge, we introduce DrugAgent, a multi-agent\nframework that automates machine learning (ML) programming for drug discovery\ntasks. DrugAgent employs an LLM Planner that formulates high-level ideas and an\nLLM Instructor that identifies and integrates domain knowledge when\nimplementing those ideas. We present case studies on three representative drug\ndiscovery tasks. Our results show that DrugAgent consistently outperforms\nleading baselines, including a relative improvement of 4.92% in ROC-AUC\ncompared to ReAct for drug-target interaction (DTI). DrugAgent is publicly\navailable at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/drugagent-5C42/.",

      "summary": "Research around AI for Science has seen significant success since the rise of\ndeep learning models over the past decade, even with longstanding challenges\nsuch as protein structure prediction. However, this fast development inevitably\nmade their flaws apparent -- especially in domains of reasoning where\nunderstanding the cause-effect relationship is important. One such domain is\ndrug discovery, in which such understanding is required to make sense of data\notherwise plagued by spurious correlations. Said spuriousness only becomes\nworse with the ongoing trend of ever-increasing amounts of data in the life\nsciences and thereby restricts researchers in their ability to understand\ndisease biology and create better therapeutics. Therefore, to advance the\nscience of drug discovery with AI it is becoming necessary to formulate the key\nproblems in the language of causality, which allows the explication of\nmodelling assumptions needed for identifying true cause-effect relationships.\n  In this attention paper, we present causal drug discovery as the craft of\ncreating models that ground the process of drug discovery in causal reasoning.",

      "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in every stage of drug\ndevelopment. Continuing breakthroughs in AI-based methods for drug discovery\nrequire the creation, improvement, and refinement of drug discovery data. We\nposit a new data challenge that slows the advancement of drug discovery AI:\ndatasets are often collected independently from each other, often with little\noverlap, creating data sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult\nfor researchers looking to answer key research questions requiring values posed\nacross multiple datasets. We propose a novel diffusion GNN model Syngand\ncapable of generating ligand and pharmacokinetic data end-to-end. We show and\nprovide a methodology for sampling pharmacokinetic data for existing ligands\nusing our Syngand model. We show the initial promising results on the efficacy\nof the Syngand-generated synthetic target property data on downstream\nregression tasks with AqSolDB, LD50, and hERG central. Using our proposed model\nand methodology, researchers can easily generate synthetic ligand data to help\nthem explore research questions that require data spanning multiple datasets.",

      "summary": "In-silico prediction of repurposable drugs is an effective drug discovery\nstrategy that supplements de-nevo drug discovery from scratch. Reduced\ndevelopment time, less cost and absence of severe side effects are significant\nadvantages of using drug repositioning. Most recent and most advanced\nartificial intelligence (AI) approaches have boosted drug repurposing in terms\nof throughput and accuracy enormously. However, with the growing number of\ndrugs, targets and their massive interactions produce imbalanced data which may\nnot be suitable as input to the classification model directly. Here, we have\nproposed DTI-SNNFRA, a framework for predicting drug-target interaction (DTI),\nbased on shared nearest neighbour (SNN) and fuzzy-rough approximation (FRA). It\nuses sampling techniques to collectively reduce the vast search space covering\nthe available drugs, targets and millions of interactions between them.\nDTI-SNNFRA operates in two stages: first, it uses SNN followed by a\npartitioning clustering for sampling the search space. Next, it computes the\ndegree of fuzzy-rough approximations and proper degree threshold selection for\nthe negative samples' undersampling from all possible interaction pairs between\ndrugs and targets obtained in the first stage. Finally, classification is\nperformed using the positive and selected negative samples. We have evaluated\nthe efficacy of DTI-SNNFRA using AUC (Area under ROC Curve), Geometric Mean,\nand F1 Score. The model performs exceptionally well with a high prediction\nscore of 0.95 for ROC-AUC. The predicted drug-target interactions are validated\nthrough an existing drug-target database (Connectivity Map (Cmap)).",
